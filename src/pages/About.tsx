                            Before I delved into the world of coding, I stirred creativity in unconventional
                            realms. <br/>
                            As a former bartender specializing in crafting intricate cocktails, I found artistry in
                            mixology,
                            blending flavors akin to the way I now blend lines of code. <br/>
                            Beyond the bar, my free moments found solace in music production,
                            where rhythms and melodies became my palette. <br/>
                            Photography, a passion that bestowed upon me « the eye » for detail, captured fleeting
                            moments
                            in frames. <br/>
                            AND of course Gaming offered not just leisure but also a canvas for problem-solving.
                            Summer 2023 introduced me to coding, and unexpectedly, it became my addiction. <br/>
                            The logic and creativity merged seamlessly, captivating me wholly.
                            Now, my days are consumed by this newfound passion, <br/>
                            as I weave the intricate tapestry of
                            technology, design, and innovation through the world of coding.
